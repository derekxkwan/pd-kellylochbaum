PD-KELLYLOCHBAUM
===========================
Ported KellyLochbaumFilterOld.java (from the Java Audio Synthesis System v1.25 by Kees van den Doel http://persianney.com/kvdoelcsubc/jass/) as [kellylochbaum~]

Might be some errors with my porting because it doesn't sound great so WIP.

NOTE FOR WINDOWS USERS:
        - I don't have an access to a windows machine so these are untested on Windows, I would try the directions up to "Building Pd-Vanilla" on the following link and then follow the regular directions:
